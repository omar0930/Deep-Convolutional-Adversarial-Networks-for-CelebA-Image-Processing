# Deep-Convolutional-Adversarial-Networks-for-CelebA-Image-Processing
## Project Structure
- **Loading and Preprocessing Data:** (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset).
- **Model Definition:** Implementation of the DCAN architecture using Keras and TensorFlow.
- **Training:** Scripts to train the DCAN model on the preprocessed CelebA dataset.
- **Data Visualization:** Tools for visualizing real and generated images.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- tensorflow
- keras
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- Dataset
This project uses the CelebA dataset, which consists of over 200,000 celebrity images with annotations. Make sure to download and place the dataset in the appropriate directory as specified in the scripts.

- Project Details
- Loading and Preprocessing Data
The data is loaded and preprocessed to ensure that the images are properly cropped and resized to 64x64 pixels. Normalization is applied to the images for efficient training.

- Model Definition
The DCAN model is built using Keras Sequential API, with layers such as Conv2D, Conv2DTranspose, BatchNormalization, LeakyReLU, and Dropout. The architecture is designed to learn and generate realistic images.

- Training
The training script leverages the preprocessed data to train the DCAN model. The training parameters and checkpoints are configurable within the script.

- Data Visualization
Visualization scripts are provided to display real images from the dataset and generated images from the trained model. This helps in understanding the model's performance and output quality.
